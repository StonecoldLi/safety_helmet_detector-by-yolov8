# safety_helmet_detector-by-yolov8
  This is a project trying to detect the safety-helmet by using Yolov8.
## Model 1: 50 imgs
  Since this model is absolutely overfitting, I would just show the confusion matrix in the following. This is just a beta model to experience the process of a cv detection work.
  The confusion matrix is like the following picture:
